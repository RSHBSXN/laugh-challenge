### What is laugh-challenge

The Try Not to Laugh challenge requires players to survive a series of funny YouTube clips (without laughing).

### Setup

The player needs to go through a funny video or compilation of clips to react to. When doing this challenge, The game detects whether you laughed or not!

Mobile or internet connection is also required in order to take part in this challenge.

### Rules

There have been many reactions to "Try Not to Laugh" compilations, which can be found on YouTube.
The player can also change the challenge difficulty which limits the number of videos the game will test the player.
